			<p>A Narrow Artificial Intelligence project I’ve been developing whenever I get bored. It’s now hosted on my inactive <a href="https://tedcss.blogspot.com" target="_blank">TEDCSS Blog</a> just for fun.</p>
			<p>It can receive commands such as navigate through pages, search for terms, open blog posts, and much more just by using your voice.</p>
			<p>It started as a testing subject, but it’s becoming more and more complex and might actually become a plugin available for purchase one of these days.<br/>
			At first it was designed to receive commands in English but now it's fully Portuguese because that’s the main language of the Blog in the first place.</p>
